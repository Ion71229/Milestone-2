## Features Left to Implement 
- When I have more time, I would like to expand the quiz by adding more general knowledge questions.

# Testing
- I tested this game in different internet browers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft anf Safari.
- I double-checked that the wording in the header, directions, options, results, and footer is clear and understandable.
- By running it through lighthouse in devtools, I validated that the colors and fonts chosen are easily readable and visible.
- This project is responsive, looks good, and works on a typical screen widths, according to my testing.
